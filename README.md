# Stockline

**Digital Assets for Everyone. No Crypto Knowledge Required.**

## From Mobile Money to Global Markets

Stockline is a product from **Mocha**, built to bridge the gap between emerging markets and the global digital economy. We believe that access to financial opportunities shouldn't be limited by geography, technical knowledge, or complex onboarding processes.

### The Problem

Billions of people in emerging markets have smartphones and use mobile money every day to send payments, pay bills, and manage their finances. Yet, these same people are locked out of global investment opportunities‚Äînot because they lack the means, but because the barriers are too high:

- **Complex crypto wallets** that require seed phrases and technical expertise
- **Unfamiliar interfaces** designed for crypto-native users
- **Multiple conversion steps** from local currency to crypto to assets
- **Knowledge gaps** about blockchain, gas fees, and digital wallets

### Our Solution

Stockline removes these barriers by meeting users where they are: **on their mobile phones, using the mobile money they already trust.**

#### How It Works

1. **Familiar Entry Point**: Users purchase digital assets using mobile money (like M-Pesa, Orange Money, or Airtel Money)‚Äîthe same way they pay for everything else in their daily lives.

2. **No Crypto Complexity**: Behind the scenes, we handle all the blockchain complexity. Users don't need to know what a wallet address is, how to buy crypto, or what gas fees are.

3. **Instant Access**: From cash in hand to owning tokenized stocks or cryptocurrency in minutes. No bank accounts. No complicated KYC. No crypto experience needed.

4. **Real Ownership**: Every purchase is backed by real digital assets on the Solana blockchain. Users own their investments, stored securely in wallets we create and manage for them.

## Why This Matters

They just need to know: **Send mobile money ‚Üí Own digital assets.**
